## About me
I am a result-oriented, multilingual masterâ€™s graduate from Germany currently looking for a job in the fields of consulting, data analytics and business intelligence. Having lived in Denmark, Germany, and Hong Kong, I enjoy the challenge of facing new problems in unfamiliar environments and tackling difficult tasks head on.

Through the combination of a strong academic background in the form of a B.Sc. in Business and a M.Sc. in Information Systems and the specialization in data analytics, I will enable my team at my future employer to make the adequate data driven decisions, minimizing risk, and maximizing results in a business context. I possess not only the problem-solving abilities to tackle complex technical issues, but also the business and communication skills to translate ample solutions to the relevant stakeholders. Furthermore, I am currently studying Machine Learning to further my technical education.

With my diverse knowledge in business and specific skills in data analytics and business intelligence I seek to bridge the gap between technical concepts and clearly formulated strategic business decisions. 

If you are looking for a long-term employee that will be a valuable asset in any team, I would be delighted to hear from you.
