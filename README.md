## About me
I am a result-oriented and driven graduate from the Freie Universit√§t Berlin currently looking for a job in Hong Kong. 
I have a B.Sc. in Business and a M.Sc. in Information Systems. Having lived in Denmark, Germany, and Hong Kong, I enjoy 
the challenge of facing new problems in unfamiliar environments and tackling difficult tasks head on. I enjoy analytical 
and critical thinking in the context of Information Technology most, which is why I chose to build upon my brought knowledge 
of information systems, by specializing in Data Analytics. I will thereby enable my team at my future employer to make 
adequate data driven decisions, thereby minimizing risk, and maximizing results. I am currently studying Machine Learning 
through Codecademy.com to further my technical education.
